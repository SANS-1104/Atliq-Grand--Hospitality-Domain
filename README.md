<h1>Project Description</h1>
<br>
<h3>
  AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel chain in India with 20 years in the industry, is losing market share and revenue due to strategic competitor moves and ineffective management decisions. To counter this, the managing director seeks to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" for strategic insights but lacks an in-house analytics team. As a data analyst, you are tasked with using sample data and a mock-up dashboard to create specified metrics, design the dashboard as per stakeholder requirements, and generate additional relevant insights not outlined in the provided metrics or mock-up.
